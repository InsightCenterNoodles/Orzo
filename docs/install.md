Installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install orzo
```

Orzo has a few dependencies:

* [`penne`](https://insightcenternoodles.github.io/Penne/): NOODLES client library
* [`moderngl`](https://moderngl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Modern OpenGL wrapper for rendering
* [`moderngl-window`](https://moderngl-window.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Windowing and event handling for OpenGL
* [`imgui`](https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Immediate mode GUI for Python
* [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): Array manipulation for Python, used in delegates

If you've got Python 3.9+ and `pip` installed, you're good to go.
